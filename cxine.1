.SH NAME

.P
cxine - a broadly mplayer-compatible libxine based media player.
.SH DESCRIPTION

.P
Cxine is a lib-xine based media player that emulates some aspects of mplayer, and adds a number of features of its own. Cxine displays video on a single window and any control output is overlaid over that.

.SH WINDOW SETTINGS 

.P
The -win argument accepts a window-type and an optional comma-separated list of extra settings. Window types are:

.TP
.B normal
 normal X11 window (is the default if no type specified)
.TP
.B fullscreen
 fullscreen window
.TP
.B 
.na
0x<win id>
.ad

 the hexidecimal (starting with 0x) id of a window to embed/reparent into

.P


.P
Additional window settings are:

.TP
.B iconized
 start with iconized/minimized window
.TP
.B minimized
 start with iconized/minimized window
.TP
.B shaded
 start with \(aqshaded\(aq window (if supported by window manager)
.TP
.B above
 keep above all other windows
.TP
.B stickontop
 shorthand for sticky,ontop
.TP
.B stickbelow
 shorthand for sticky,below

.P
Examples:

.nf

  \-win fullscreen,min         fullscreen window that\(aqs minimized at startup
  \-win sticky                 normal window that appears on all desktops
  \-win normal,shaded,below    normal window starts shaded and below other windows
  \-win 0x1f2bc                embed into window with hexadecimal id 1f2bc
.fi
.ad b

.P
When embedding cxine into another application (e.g. a frontend) window ids can be given to \(aq-win\(aq either in hex (with a leading 0x) or in decimal.
.SH BOOKMARKS

.P
By default cxine \(aqbookmarks\(aq the position in a video if exit is requested, and restarts from that position if the media is played again. This can be disabled with \(aq-no-bookmark\(aq or  \(aq-startms 0\(aq. 
.SH DVD PLAYBACK

.P
DVDs can be played using the urls \(aqdvd://0\(aq to use dvdnav menu screen, or \(aqdvd://1\(aq, \(aqdvd://2\(aq, etc to play a particular track on disk. The particular dvd device to read from can be set with \(aq-dvd-device\(aq.
.SH DOWNLOADS AND REMOTE MEDIA STREAMS

.P
CXine downloads media using helper apps. Default config will use curl, wget or Twighbright links, elinks, lynx, or snarf, depending on which are found in your path your path. Cxine should be able to accept ftp: ftps: sftp: and smb: urls via curl, but these have not been tested.
.P
You can also use \(aqssh:\(aq (not sftp, this actually streams files over ssh) urls if ssh is in your path, although these have to be set up in your \(aq.ssh/config\(aq to auto-login. So, for example the url \(aqssh://myhost/home/music/BinaryFinary.mp3\(aq will log into \(aqmyhost\(aq and use ssh to pull the file \(aq/home/music/BinaryFinary.mp3\(aq provided that \(aqmyhost\(aq has been set up in your .config with an ssh key to log in with.
.P
More information about helpers is available with \(aqcxine \(hyhelp helpers\(aq
.P
The \(aq-stream\(aq option is intended for use with internet radio, and only works for http:// streams. If \(aq-stream\(aq is supplied then http:// urls will be streamed without being downloaded to the cache directory
.SH XINE BROADCAST

.P
Cxine supports libxine-style broadcast. If the \(aq-bcast\(aq option is used to specify a port then any libxine player (xine, cxine, oxine etc) should be able to connect to it using the url \(aqslave://<address>:<port> and mirror it\(aqs output.
.SH SAVE CONFIGURATION

.P
If \(aq-save-config\(aq is given then cxine will remember the following settings if they are supplied:

.nf

		\-vo, \-ao, \-ac, \-ap, \-prefix, \-keygrab, \-persist/\-quit, \-bookmark/\-no\-bookmark, \-screensaver/+screensaver, \-show\-osd/\-hide\-osd, \-background, \-input, \-cache, \-nowplay,  \-dvd\-device, \-dvd\-region, \-dvd\-lang, \-helpers
.fi
.ad b

.P
-defaults resets the config to default. It will also reset any settings prior to it  on the command-line, so it\(aqs best to pass it as the first option. You can set configs to defaults, make some changes, and then save, like this:

.nf

		cxine \-defaults \-background myimage.jpg \-ao alsa \-keygrab media \-save
.fi
.ad b

.SS On Screen Displays

.P
CXine supports on-screen-displays at the top and bottom of the screen. These are defined using the 
.na
\-osd
.ad
switch like so:
.P
cxine -osd 
.na
top,%t now playing: %T
.ad
-osd 
.na
bottom,%tP%% %ts/%tl
.ad
.P
The argument of the -osd option is a pair of comma-seperated strings. The first is 
.na
top
.ad
or 
.na
bottom
.ad
indicating which area of the screen the OSD should be displayed in. The second is the string to display, with the following printf-style 
.na
%
.ad
substitutions supported:

.nf

.fi
.ad b

.P
Onscreen displays only work if there\(aqs a video stream for them to mix into. Thus, to have an OSD when playing audio files you should either use the -background option to set a default background image, or use one of the audio post-processing visualizations, or else supply cxine with a .jpeg or .png image as the first 
.na
track
.ad
to play, and use the 
.na
\-image\-time
.ad
or 
.na
\-imagems
.ad
options to cause the next track to start playing after the image is displayed. The image will persist and be the 
.na
video
.ad
stream for the OSD to mix into.
.SS Playlist OSD

.P
Pressing \(aqp\(aq brings up the Playlist On Screen Display. This is a simple menu whose cursor is controlled with the arrow keys on the keyboard. Putting the cursor on a particular item and pressing \(aqenter\(aq will switch playback to that item. Pressing \(aqu\(aq or \(aqd\(aq when an item has the cursor on it will move the item up and down in the playlist. Pressing \(aqdelete\(aq or \(aqbackspace\(aq will delete an item from the playlist. Finally pressing \(aqp\(aq again will dismiss the Playlist OSD.
.SS Load Files OSD

.P
Pressing \(aql\(aq brings up the Load Files On Screen Display. This is a simple menu whose cursor is controlled with the arrow keys on the keyboard. Putting the cursor on a particular item and pressing \(aqenter\(aq will either enter a directory, or add a file to the playlist. Pressing \(aqdelete\(aq or \(aqbackspace\(aq go up one directory level. Pressing \(aql\(aq again will dismiss this menu.
.SS Keybindings

.P
CXine supports the following keys:

.nf

\..               reset window to \(aqnormal\(aq mode. (turns off \(aqabove\(aq, \(aqbelow\(aq and \(aqshaded\(aq modes)

.P
The \(aq+\(aq and \(aq-\(aq keys represent a departure from mplayer. On the keypad they work as expected, with the \(aqshift\(aq modifier alowing change of audio compression. However, on UK keyboards you have to press shift to get \(aq+\(aq on the non-keypad part of the keyboard. This creates confusion. Hence on the normal keyboard \(aq=\(aq and \(aq-\(aq change volume up and down, and their shifted versions \(aq\fI\(') and \(')+\(') alter audio compression.

The following keys on \(')internet\(') or \(')media\(') keyboards are supported:
\pp-
\bc+
\(<)play\(>)
\(<)stop\(>)
\(<)pause playback\(>)
\(<)next\(>)
\(<)previous\(>)
\(<)volume up\(>)     with \(')shift\(') causes a larger increase
\(<)volume down\(>)   with \(')shift\(') causes a larger decrease
\(<)volume mute\(>)

CXine can grab keys for its exclusive use, meaning that that those keystrokes will be sent to it regardless of what window currently has input focus. Keygrabs are supplied to the program in a comma-seperated list after the \cdi-keygrab\end option. Recognized key names are either alphanumeric characters and punctuation, or the following names:
\pp-
\bc+
up, down, left, right       arrow keys
pgup, pgdn, home, end       page-up, page-down, home and end keys
pgup, pgdn, home, end       page-up, page-down, home and end keys
ins, del                    insert and delete keys
vup, vdown, mute            volume up, down and mute keys found on \(')internet\(') keyboards
stop, play, next, prev      playback keys found on \(')internet\(') keyboards
vpause                      media pause key found on \(')internet\(') keyboards
\bc-
\pp+
CXine also supports the following \(')group\(') names that grab groups of keys:
\pp-
\bc+
arrow                       left right up down
volume                      vup, vdown, mute
page                        pgup, pgdn
nav                         left, right, up, down, pgup, pgdn, home, end
media                       vup, vdown, mute, stop, play, prev, next, vpause
keypad                      up, down, left, right pgup, pgdn, home, end, +, -
\bc-
\pp+
All key and group names can have a modifier prepended. Available modifiers are \cdishift-\end, \cdicntrl-\end and \cdialt-\end. If a key-modifier pair isn\cdit bound to an action, then cxine will treat the key as though it had no modifier. Thus \endalt-o\cdi can be bound to turn OSD display on-and-off without depriving other programs of use of the \endo\cdi key.
