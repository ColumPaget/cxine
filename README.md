CXine - A mostly mplayer compatible libxine media player
--------------------------------------------------------

CXine is a basic, keyboard-driven, X11, lib-xine based media player that is intended to be used as a keyboard-driven standalone app, or embedded in a frontend. It supports a subset of the mplayer 'slave mode' command protocol. It supports user-configurable on screen displays; embedding into another window, sticky, shaded and stayontop windows; drawing on the root window; fullscreen playback, keygrabs and 'bookmarking' (remembering position in a media item).
